# 🚀 Work Order System - Million Dollar Roadmap

To transform this application into a premium, enterprise-grade solution, we will implement the following phases.

## Phase 1: Visual Evidence & Accountability (The "Field Tech" Experience)
*   **📸 Photo Attachments**: Allow workers to upload "Before" and "After" photos for every job.
*   **✨ Image Gallery**: A sleek carousel view to browse evidence.
*   **✍️ Digital Signatures**: Capture customer signatures on-screen to close out work orders.
*   **📱 Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the worker portal is 100% touch-friendly.

## Phase 2: Inspections & Audits (New Module)
*   **✅ Custom Checklists**: Create digital inspection forms (Pass/Fail/NA) for equipment or safety checks.
*   **🔄 Recurring Schedules**: Set up daily, weekly, or monthly inspection routines.
*   **⚠️ Auto-Ticket Generation**: Automatically create a work order if an inspection item is marked "Fail".
*   **🏷️ Asset Tagging**: Workers can assign Barcodes/QR codes to assets and link them to specific Categories during inspections.

## Phase 3: Master Data Management (The Foundation)
*   **🏢 Location Registry**: Define a standard list of Buildings, Floors, and Rooms to avoid messy data (e.g., "Room 101" vs "Rm 101").
*   **📂 Hierarchical Categories**: Implement "Parent" and "Child" categories (e.g., *Electrical* → *Fire Alarms*, *Lighting*, *Generators*).
*   **👷 Worker Skills**: Tag workers with specific skills (e.g., "John" can do *Plumbing* but not *HVAC*) for smarter assignment.

## Phase 4: Command Center & Advanced Search (The "Brain")
*   **🔍 Global Search**: Instantly find any ticket by ID, keyword, or asset tag.
*   **🌪️ Smart Filters**: Filter by Location, Asset Type, Worker, Year, Priority, and Status.
*   **🗺️ Interactive Map View**: Admins see work orders as pins on a map to optimize travel routes.
*   **📅 Drag-and-Drop Calendar**: A visual scheduler for assigning tasks to workers.
*   **📊 Advanced Analytics**: Charts showing completion rates, average repair times, and worker performance.

## Phase 5: Customer Delight (The "Uber" Experience)
*   **🔗 Public Tracking Links**: Customers get a unique URL to track their request status in real-time.
*   **🔔 Email/SMS Notifications**: Automatic updates when status changes.
*   **⭐ Feedback System**: Allow customers to rate the service after completion.

## Phase 6: Enterprise Asset & Cost Management (The "ROI" Layer)
*   **🏭 Asset Digital Twin**: Track history for specific equipment (e.g., "HVAC Unit #3").
*   **🔳 QR Code Scanning**: Stick QR codes on assets. Scan to view history or report an issue instantly.
*   **📦 Inventory & Parts**: Track spare parts usage (e.g., "Used 1x Filter") and calculate total repair costs automatically.
*   **💰 Budgeting**: See exactly how much was spent on "Plumbing" vs "Electrical" this year.

## Phase 7: The "One of a Kind" Features (Innovation)
*   **🎙️ Voice-to-Text Reporting**: Workers can dictate their notes instead of typing on small screens.
*   **👷 External Vendor Portal**: Give limited access to 3rd party contractors (plumbers, electricians) to view/close their assigned jobs.
*   **⏱️ SLA Countdown**: "Critical" tickets get a countdown timer. If time runs out, it auto-escalates to the manager.
*   **🤖 AI Triage**: Automatically detect category and priority from the description (e.g., "smoke" = Critical).
